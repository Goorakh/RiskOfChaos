He leaped into the armor press \u2014 letting the plates be magnetized to his suit \u2014 grabbed his laser rifle mkII off the wall, and ran down the corridor. It was a short corridor. The ship was a C class fighter outfitted for a small team. Minimal rooms, built for speed. \r\n\r\n\r\nRez burst into the cockpit two strides later, heavy greaves scraping against the metal floor as he ground himself to a halt, gun at the ready.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CRez what the fuck.\u201D Pearson said, gesturing at the scratches in the aluminum floor. \u201CAre you serious? You ruined my floor..\u201D He pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration, \u201Cwhy are you so...\u201D He looked up at the ceiling. \u201CMoons guide me..\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s here.\u201D Rez said, already out of breath. \u201CIn this system.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201COh really? Couldn\u2019t tell..\u201D Pearson swiveled his chair back to the ship controls. \u201CBetween the red light and the screaming in my ear I thought it was nap time.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy aren\u2019t you taking this seriously?\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CListen, Rez, I kinda am.\u201D Pearson said, taking a deep breath and typing something into the panel. \u201CBut you\u2019re really \u2014 really \u2014 annoying.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CI am an official certified cadet in training for the U.S.S Fleetwood you can\u2019t talk to me like-\u201C\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201COh here we go..\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201C-that and undermine my authority. I come from a long line of soldiers and I absolutely won\u2019t stand to be disrespected like that in my own ship.\u201D Rez said, straightening his posture. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry,\u201D Pearson said, pushing his swivel chair away from the desk to face Rez, \u201Cyour ship..?\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nRez nodded. \u201CAfter Sami was taken, the ship became mine.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nPearson stared at Rez with an incredulous look. \u201CI don\u2019t even know where to begin, you fucking imbecile.\u201D He stood up, fists clenched at his sides. \u201CBut let\u2019s start with this.\u201D Pearson pointed at Rez, \u201CSami is fucking dead and you not accepting that reality is driving us to the ends of the universe looking for some god adjacent hyper lizard. And for what honestly? Like really \u2013 just to die?\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CTo get Sami back.\u201D Rez said, raising his chin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are beyond help actually. You are quite literally the dumbest creature I\u2019ve ever met in my entire life.\u201D Pearson said, \u201Cwe literally saw her explode into infinity. The god lizard EXPLODED HER INTO INFINITY.\u201D Pearson yelled, clapping his hands with each word. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CThat doesn\u2019t change anything, I know what I know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat? What doesn\u2019t change anything? Us seeing her die?\u201D Pearson turned away from Rez, raising his arms up, \u201CMoons above please smite me down right now, as I stand. What damnation have you thrown me into? For what purpose? What have I done to deserve such a divine punishment? What must I do to seek penance?\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nRez glanced at the dashboard monitor, yellow flashes indicating large spikes of energy were busting out from the continent below them on the signal map. He set his rifle down and set his palms down onto the desk, leaning forward into the monitor, his breath fogging up the screen. This was HIS energy signature. Nothing else on the entire planet came even close to replicating that level of power surge. But there was something else. A small signal, two tiny bursts of red showing up a continent apart at the same time, the giant yellow flashes overlaid over one of them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CHey I think-\u201C Rez turned, his hand bumping a mug off the dashboard and onto the floor, shattering it, spilling coffee everywhere. \r\n\r\n\r\nPearson slowly turned, unreadable expression on his face. \r\n\r\n\r\nRez shrugged at the mess then looked back to Pearson, \u201CI think Leonard isn\u2019t alone down there. There\u2019s another signal.\u201D \r\n\r\n\r\nPearson was just staring at the broken cup and the coffee spreading over the scarred aluminum, smile on his face, eyebrows raised. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CThis might be the perfect time to strike.\u201D Rez said, slamming a fist into his other hand. \u201CYou know, for tactics.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CFor.. tactics?\u201D Pearson said, slowly looking up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CYeah like you know,\u201D Rez said, reaching for his gun, \u201Cforking and pinchers and stuff.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CIn all of the universe, in its infinite breadth and unlimited possibility, of course I had to find myself in the same ship as you. The dumbest and most annoying animal this life has had the audacity to create; how it is you obtained sentience I have no clue.\u201D \r\n\r\n\r\nRez sighed, \u201CSami doesn\u2019t want to see us fighting.\u201D \r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CSAMI IS DEAD MOTHER FUCKER. THE GOD LIZARD \u2014 whatever stupid shit you call him, Linus or som-\u201C\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CLeonard.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CLEONARD! GOOD!\u201D Pearson said, throwing his arms up. \u201CLet\u2019s give the seemingly all powerful omnipotent god reptilian a stupid name while we\u2019re at it. Yes! Of course! And that-\u201C Pearson said, pointing to the broken mug, \u201Cwas my favorite cup by the way. And this,\u201D pointing around them, \u201Cis my fucking ship. I paid for it with my own credits before I ever met you or Sami you fucking dipshit. I swear to the Moons above you were created by the cosmos just to piss me off.\u201D \r\n\r\n\r\nRez looked over at the monitor, the energy map showing dissipations of the energy signals. He rushed and moved closer again, pressing his forehead to the monitor to see as close as he could. The yellow flashes of energy were gone. \r\n\u201CGreat,\u201D Rez said, pulling away, leaving a grease stain on the monitor where his forehead touched it. \u201CLeonard\u2019s signal is gone. You and your disobedience ruined our chances. Again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CGet the fuck out of my room.\u201D",

It is less.. nothing than I thought it would be.. my awareness is.. strange. I feel everything and nothing simultaneously. I understand the concept of eternity, I feel it, I\u2019ve lived it, I\u2019m experiencing it at this very moment. This moment is eternity in all directions. I understand that now. It always has been and always will be.\r\nAnd yet I feel nothing. \r\nI\u2019ve been here before. \r\nI felt infinity. I feel it now. A permanent scar on my soul \u2013 if that\u2019s what it is. Forever changed. Brought into infinity, into eternity, but always there. \r\n        I\u2019ve always felt it.\r\nConsciousness isn\u2019t the right word, but it\u2019s the only thing I can articulate. I don\u2019t want to lose it. \r\nKeep thinking. \r\nThese.. thoughts I have, they have meaning. I can sense they\u2019re real. Or maybe I just choose to believe they are. \r\nBelieving is dangerous. \r\nI\u2019m swelling with understanding about the fabric of infinity and yet.. the most basic of answers elude me. \r\nIs this real?\r\nWhat is this place? \r\nWhat is happening to me?\r\nDid I die?\r\n.. \r\n... \r\n....\r\nMaybe. \r\nI don\u2019t know. I expected.. less from death. \r\n        I\u2019ve been here before. \r\nIt is less.. nothing than I thought it would be.. my awareness is.. strange. I feel everything and nothing simultaneously. \r\n        How long have I been stuck in this cycle? \r\nI understand the concept of eternity, I feel it, I\u2019ve lived it, I\u2019m experiencing it at this very moment. \r\n        I see. \r\nThis moment is eternity in all directions. I understand that now.

I.. \r\n. ..   . .   . . .. ..  .. .  . .. \r\n        Have I broken the cycle?\r\n        ..        \r\n        ...\r\n        Maybe. I don\u2019t know. \r\nI expected.. more from breaking it. It is less... \r\n        Further.\r\nnothing than I thought it would be. \r\n        Again. \r\n.. .. .. .\r\n.. .. . .\r\n. ... .\r\n        I see. \r\n        It is all one cycle. It replays into infinity. Eternity beyond. This is part of it. \r\n        As much as I\u2019d like to think it isn\u2019t. As much as I want to believe I \r\ncan break it.\r\n        I cannot. \r\nI see the threads of infinity. \r\n        It is a circle. \r\n        I should pay attention while I\u2019m here. Everything happens all at once and \r\n        yet I feel that this is a singular distinct moment inside the weave.\r\n        What do I feel, beyond the overwhelming sense of eternity?\r\n        ..\r\n        Interesting. \r\n        I sense a trace of a severed link. \r\nHas it always been there?\r\nFollow it.\r\n        Physicality. Familiarity. \r\n        Recollection. \r\n        That\u2019s right. I used to be someone. \r\n        Sami. \r\n        Does that name mean anything to me?\r\n        .. \r\n        I don\u2019t know. I feel it should..\r\n        This link.. is swelling with connection. Memory.\r\n        Reflections on the pool of infinity revealing somewhere else.\r\n        Somewhere I\u2019ve been.\r\n        But everything is splintered, I don\u2019t understand how the pieces fit.\r\n        Endless shards of a broken mirror.\r\n        Memories.. seem like invaders in this place. It feels odd witnessing \r\nsomething so small shine so brightly in the essence of eternity. \r\n        And yet despite their fractures.. I remember feelings.\r\n        I remember anger. \r\n        I remember love. \r\n        Simply impressions \u2013 hollow and dormant \u2013 but I can discern them clearly.\r\nTheir purpose forgotten.. but these remnants once held potency. \r\nInteresting how the recall of emotion \u2013 of all things \u2013 carries through.\r\nI wish that I could experience them again.\r\n..\r\n        Something tells me I would cry if I were able.\r\n        Focus.\r\n        Focus on the link.\r\n.. \r\n        Interesting.\r\n                The link is not as severed as I thought. It\u2019s just.. distant. Removed.\r\n                Does it lie outside of the cycle?\r\n                        Impossible. \r\n                But it does seem that way.. I can.. perceive. \r\nUnless the soul stores memory.. and this is a recursive recollection..\r\n                Imprints of eternity.\r\n                Plausible..\r\n                Focus. \r\n                Why does this connection embody such a powerful kinship?\r\n                How can I conceive of its corporeal nature beyond this?\r\n                ..\r\n                Ah. \r\nBecause it is me \u2013 or was me.\r\n                I can see that now. \r\n                I am separated from myself somehow, what I was. \r\nMy essence from my being.\r\nMy soul from my blood.\r\n                And yet, the link remains.\r\n                Tentatively. In a way I cannot describe.\r\n                Interesting.\r\n                I cannot move my body; it is no longer mine to control.\r\n                I cannot use my eyes; they are no longer mine to control. \r\n                I cannot use my mind..\r\n                I thought that\u2019s what this was. What I was. \r\n                        Believing is dangerous.\r\n                What am I? \r\n                ..\r\n                There\u2019s something else.\r\n                There\u2019s something else. There\u2019s something else. There\u2019s something else.\r\n                There\u2019s something else. There\u2019s something else. There\u2019s something else.\r\n                There\u2019s something else. There\u2019s something else.

I feel. Somehow. \r\nIts presence is ineffable yet tangible. \r\nAnd it is.. vast.\r\nMy concept of infinity feels infinitesimal in its vicinity.\r\nI thought I could understand infinity, limitless eternity.\r\n        You can\u2019t.\r\nBut this.. is incomprehensible to me.\r\nI should hide.\r\n        You can\u2019t.\r\nDoes it know what I\u2019m thinking?\r\nCan it tell I\u2019ve reached outside my domain?\r\nI should hide. \r\n... \r\n...\r\nDid I die?\r\n..\r\n...\r\n....\r\nMaybe.
