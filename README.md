# Risk of Chaos

Every minute, a random effect happens. Multiplayer combatible! Every player needs to have the mod installed.

Heavily inspired by the "Chaos Mod" series of GTA games.

Currently features 63 different effects.

### Twitch Integration:

Twitch integration allows viewers to vote for the next effect.

To set up Twitch voting, set the General->Streamer Integration->Voting Mode config to "Twitch", then open the console, and use the command "roc_twitch_login" then provide your channel name and oauth token (ex. "roc_twitch_login goorakh oauth:yourtokengoeshere"). Note: Login info is saved between game restarts, but you will have to re-enter it after updating the mod.
